# Privacy Policy (Prown)

**Effective date:** 2025-12-16

This Privacy Policy explains how Prown collects, uses, and shares information when you use the Prown website and services (the “Service”).

> Prown is currently operated by its founders (José Fernandez Portal and Marcos Sponton). “Prown” refers to the service offered by the founders until a legal entity is formed.

## 1. Scope

This Privacy Policy applies when Prown acts as a **data controller** for:
- Prown’s website, marketing, and account administration; and
- “Free” or “self-serve” versions of the Service where Prown determines the purposes and means of processing.

When Prown is used by an organization, partner, or customer as part of a client engagement, Prown typically acts as a **data processor** or **sub-processor** and processes personal data only on instructions from that organization. In those cases, the organization’s privacy notice and agreements govern.

## 2. Information we collect

We may collect:

### 2.1 Account and identity information
- Name, email address, profile information provided via OAuth providers (e.g., Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn), and identifiers necessary to authenticate you.

### 2.2 Service content (depending on the use case)
- Interview transcripts and structured outputs (“debriefs”) produced from interviews when the Service is used to conduct interviews or capture feedback.

### 2.3 Usage and technical information
- Log data such as IP address, device/browser information, timestamps, and interaction metadata required for security and service operation.

## 3. How we use information

We use information to:
- Provide and operate the Service;
- Authenticate users and enforce access controls (multi-tenant authorization);
- Maintain security, prevent abuse, and troubleshoot issues;
- Evaluate and improve Service quality (e.g., latency, cost, prompt/model evaluations), including via observability tooling.

## 4. Sharing and disclosures

We may share information with:
- **Service providers (subprocessors)** that help us run the Service (see [Subprocessors](./subprocessors.md)).
- **Partners or customers** where the Service is used as part of their engagement, consistent with their instructions and agreements.
- Authorities or third parties where required by law, to protect rights, or to prevent fraud/security incidents.

We do not sell personal data.

## 5. Data retention

We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes described above, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

Where Prown acts as a processor/sub-processor, retention is governed by the applicable customer/partner agreement and instructions.

## 6. Data deletion and requests

If you are using a self-serve or free version where Prown is the controller, you may request deletion or access by contacting us (see Contact below).

If you are a participant in interviews conducted on behalf of a customer/partner, please direct requests to the organization that invited you, as they control the processing.

## 7. International data transfers

Depending on where you are located and where our subprocessors operate, your data may be processed outside your country. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers.

## 8. Security

We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information, including access controls and tenant isolation. See [Security & Data Practices](./security-and-data-practices.md) for a high-level overview.

## 9. Changes

We may update this Privacy Policy. The effective date above indicates when it was last updated.
