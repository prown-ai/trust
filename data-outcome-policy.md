# Data & Outcome Policy (Prown)

**Effective date:** 2025-12-16

This document summarizes Prown’s approach to data ownership, usage, and partner collaboration.

## 1) Data ownership

- The end customer owns their data:
  - interview inputs (transcripts / recordings, if applicable),
  - outputs (debriefs, opportunity backlog, solution drafts).
- Prown processes customer data to provide the Service and does not use customer data to provide consulting services that compete with the partner in that account.

## 2) Platform and IP

- Prown owns the platform (software, interview engine, prompt systems, UX, generic solution patterns, scoring, etc.).
- Partners may not use access to Prown to build a direct competitor to the Prown platform.

## 3) Partner IP

- Partners own their playbooks, implementation methodologies, and customer relationships.
- If partners create custom interviews/blueprints/configurations inside Prown, partner-specific content and business logic remain partner IP unless otherwise agreed.

## 4) What Prown learns globally

Prown may learn from aggregated and de-identified usage patterns, such as:
- which problem types appear more often by role/industry,
- which solution approaches perform better,
- which UX patterns improve completion and response rates.

This is used to improve the Service for all users without reusing partner/customer content 1:1.
